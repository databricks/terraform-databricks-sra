## Overview

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

    For feedback, questions, and comments — please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/databricks/terraform-databricks-sra/issues).

    Please review the [Project Support](/docs/overview#project-support) section for important information on support and service terms.

The **Security Reference Architecture (SRA)** with Terraform provides a prescriptive deployment pattern for Databricks on **Azure**, designed for highly secure and regulated environments.
It captures Databricks security best practices in Terraform templates, allowing organizations to programmatically deploy workspaces and supporting infrastructure with hardened, opinionated defaults.

This architecture emphasizes:
    * **Secure by Default** – Environments are provisioned with restrictive networking, managed identites, and encryption controls.
    * **Governance & Compliance** – Aligns with industry standards and simplifies audits through consistent, automated configurations.
    * **Scalability** – Built on a hub-and-spoke model to isolate workloads, enforce least privilege, and simplify cross-environment connectivity.
    * **Point-in-Time Design** – Each release reflects security best practices at that time; new releases may not be drop-in replacements.

The **Azure** implementation of the **Security Reference Architecture (SRA)** includes:
    * Hub-and-Spoke model for network segmentation, workload isolation, and to simplify cross-environment connectivity. 
    * Core **Azure** components such as Vnet Injection, privatelink endpoints, managed identities, Azure Storage Accounts, and Azure Key Vault.
    * Core **Databricks** components including Unity Catalog, network connectivty configurations, and network policies for serverless compute. 

## Next Steps

* Review the [Read Before Deploying](./preread.mdx) section for critical considerations.
* Choose your [Deployment Mode](./deploymentmodes.mdx) based on your infrastructure (full SRA-managed, bring-your-own hub, or bring-your-own spoke network).
* Explore the [Configuration Reference](./configuration.mdx) for detailed information on all available configuration options including security features, CMK, SAT, and network egress controls.
* Understand the [SRA Components Breakdown](./components.mdx) to learn about the included **Azure** and **Databricks** resources.
* Follow the [Getting Started](./gettingstarted.mdx) guide to deploy using Terraform.
* Check the [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.mdx) guide if you encounter any issues during deployment.
