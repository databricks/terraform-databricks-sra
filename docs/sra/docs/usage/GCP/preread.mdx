# Read Before Deploying

## Key Considerations
The **Security Reference Architecture (SRA)** is a purpose-built, simplified deployment pattern designed for highly secure and regulated customers.

This architecture includes specific functionalities that may affect certain use cases, as outlined below.

* **Private Service Connect (PSC) Dependencies**: This deployment implements **back-end** Private Service Connect (PSC) to ensure all workspace-to-control-plane traffic stays on the Google Cloud backbone.
    * DNS records are automatically configured through Private Cloud DNS zones.
    * The template **does not** include front-end PSC (for user-to-workspace traffic). If your security posture requires full private connectivity for user access, front-end PSC must be configured separately following the [Databricks documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/gcp/en/security/network/classic/private-service-connect).

* **Customer-Managed VPC Configuration**: The workspace is deployed into a [Customer-Managed VPC](https://docs.databricks.com/gcp/en/security/network/classic/customer-managed-vpc) to provide control over routing, firewall rules, and subnet segmentation.
    * Ensure your organizationâ€™s security team reviews VPC peering or Shared VPC configurations before deployment.
    * Adjust subnet CIDR ranges and routes as needed to align with your network design standards.

* **Cloud KMS Integration**: Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) are created via Cloud KMS and attached to both managed services and workspace storage.

## Customizations
