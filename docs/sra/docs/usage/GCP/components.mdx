# SRA Components Breakdown

This section outlines the core components of the **Security Reference Architeture (SRA)**. Several `.tf` scripts contain direct links to the Databricks Terraform documention.
The full Databricks Terraform Provider Documentation can be found [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/databricks/databricks/latest/docs).

## Core GCP Components
* **Customer-Managed VPC**: A [Customer-Managed VPC](https://docs.databricks.com/gcp/en/security/network/classic/customer-managed-vpc) provides full control over network configuration, routing, and segmentation. This setup is required for **Private Service Connect (PSC)** and enables centralized management of multiple workspaces within a single, compliant network environment.
* **Back-End Private Service Connect (PSC)**: Establishes private connectivity between the Databricks control plane and the customer-managed VPC. This ensures that all control plane and compute plane communication remains on the Google Cloud backbone, eliminating public internet exposure.
    >**NOTE**: Front-end PSC for user-to-workspace connectivity is **not** included in this deployment. 
* **Cloud KMS Keys (CMEK)**: Implements customer-managed encryption keys for both control planeâ€“managed services (such as notebooks, secrets, and Databricks SQL query data) and workspace storage (including Cloud Storage buckets and GCE Persistent Disks).

After the workspace is created, the following components are provisioned:

* **Cloud DNS**: Configures private DNS zones required for PSC to resolve internal Databricks service endpoints to private IPs within the VPC, maintaining isolation and secure communication between components.
