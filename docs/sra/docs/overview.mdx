The **Security Reference Architecture (SRA)** with Terraform provides a streamlined way to deploy Databricks workspaces and supporting cloud infrastructure with security best practices built in.
Using the official Databricks Terraform provider, environments are programmatically set up with hardened configurations modeled after our most security-conscious customers. 
The included templates are built on [Databricks Security Best Practices](https://www.databricks.com/trust/security-features#best-practices), providing a strong, prescriptive foundation for secure deployments.

Beyond secure deployment, the **Security Reference Architecture (SRA)** supports governance by aligning with industry standards and compliance frameworks. 
Automated infrastructure provisioning reduces operational overhead, while consistent, hardened configurations simplify audits and lower risk. 
At the same time, the Terraform templates are flexible and extensible, enabling customization to meet unique organizational needs without compromising on security best practices.
