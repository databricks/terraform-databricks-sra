# The variables block below provides variable values for the SRA module directly, NOT the configuration that is found in
# this directory (aws-gov/tf). This is because the module call in sra.tf contains values that must be overwritten by the
# user of SRA. Calling the module directly allows us to provide these values as variables instead.
