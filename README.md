## Project Overview

The [Security Reference Architecture (SRA)](https://databricks.github.io/terraform-databricks-sra/) with Terraform enables deployment of Databricks workspaces and cloud infrastructure configured with security best practices. Using the official Databricks Terraform provider, environments are programmatically set up with hardened configurations modeled after our most security-conscious customers. The included templates are built on [Databricks Security Best Practices](https://www.databricks.com/trust/security-features#best-practices), providing a strong, prescriptive foundation for secure deployments.
