## Project Overview

Security Reference Architecture (SRA) with Terraform templates makes deploying workspaces with Security Best Practices easy.

These unified Terraform templates are pre-configured with hardened security settings similar to our most security-conscious customers. The initial templates based on [Databricks Security Best Practices](https://www.databricks.com/trust/security-features#best-practices)
